# BLIND VISION

## Overview
Blind individuals often face challenges in performing daily tasks independently due to their dependence on others for understanding their surroundings. This project aims to address some of these challenges by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to develop spectacles that provide real-time assistance to visually impaired individuals.

## Features
- **Real-Time Environment Navigation**: The spectacles use AI technology to assist visually impaired individuals in self-navigation within their environment, providing real-time feedback on their surroundings.
- **Facial Recognition**: Integrated facial recognition technology enables users to recognize people sitting in front of them, enhancing social interactions and independence.
- **OCR Technology**: Optical Character Reader (OCR) technology allows visually impaired individuals to read printed text such as books and newspapers, providing access to information and literature.

## How it Works
1. **Environment Navigation**: The AI-powered spectacles utilize sensors and cameras to capture and interpret the surrounding environment. The processed data is then translated into auditory or tactile feedback to guide the user in navigation.
2. **Facial Recognition**: The facial recognition module analyzes images captured by the spectacles' cameras, identifying individuals and providing verbal or tactile feedback to the user.
3. **OCR Technology**: Printed text is captured by the spectacles' cameras and processed using OCR technology. The extracted text is then converted into audio format, allowing users to listen to the content through headphones or speakers.

## Usage
- **Navigation**: Simply wear the AI-assisted spectacles and activate the navigation mode. Follow the auditory or tactile cues to navigate safely within your environment.
- **Facial Recognition**: Activate the facial recognition feature to identify individuals around you. Receive verbal or tactile feedback about the person sitting in front of you.
- **Reading**: Use the OCR feature to capture text from books or newspapers. Listen to the extracted text through headphones or speakers for convenient reading.
